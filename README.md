# TranslateMate

TranslateMate is a language translation application that leverages machine learning models to provide accurate translations between English and multiple languages. The Python app is built using [Anvil](https://anvil.works) for the frontend and [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for the backend.

## Features

- **Language Translation:** Translate text from English to French, German, Spanish, Italian, Russian, and Dutch.
- **Transliteration:** Convert Russian text to its phonetic equivalent in Latin script.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Convert translated text to speech with a single button click.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- An Anvil account
- A Google Colab account
- Python environment with the following libraries installed:
  - `virtualenv`
  - `anvil-uplink`
  - `transformers`
  - `torch`
  - `torchvision`
  - `torchaudio`
  - `sacremoses`
  - `transliterate`

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monisharavi729735/TranslateMateML.git
   cd TranslateMateML

2. **Set Up Google Colab**
- Open the .ipynb file in Google Colab.
- Install the required packages by running the setup cells.
- Connect to the Anvil Uplink by replacing the placeholder with your Anvil Uplink key.

  ```python
  import anvil.server
  anvil.server.connect("your-anvil-uplink-key")

3. Run the Application

- Run all cells in the Google Colab notebook to start the server.

## Using the Application
- Open the Anvil app in your browser.
- Enter the text you want to translate and select the target language.
- Click the "Translate" button to get the translated text.
- For Russian, the transliterated text will also be provided.
- Click the "Text-to-Speech" button to hear the translation spoken aloud.

## Project Structure
- `TranslateMateML.ipynb`: Main Google Colab notebook containing the backend code.
- `anvil_app`: Folder containing the Anvil app files.

## Models Used
- `English to French`: [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr](Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr)
- `English to German`: [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de](Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-de)
- `English to Spanish`: [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-es](Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-tc-big-en-es)
- `English to Italian`: [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-it](Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-it)
- `English to Russian`: [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ru](Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-ru)
- `English to Dutch`: [Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-nl](Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-nl)

## BLEU Score Evaluation
The BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) score is used to evaluate the quality of the translations. The scores for each language pair are calculated in the notebook using sample sentences and human-generated reference translations.
